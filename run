# This is the run file for sub image comparison solution
# ADDRESS is the variable for different dataset
# We should change the value of ADDRESS to right one if dataset is changed

#ADDRESS=falcon-hood

# download the original xml file
#wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/elephant-ramhacks-$ADDRESS

# create two directories
# source is for original images
# targets is for sub images
#mkdir source; mkdir targets

# mf.py is written by python which is used to get the write url address for all original and sub images
# mf.py creates two files:
# src_list: includes all urls for original images
# tar_list: includes all urls for sub images
#python mf.py elephant-ramhacks-$ADDRESS https://s3.amazonaws.com/elephant-ramhacks-$ADDRESS

# delete the original xml file after we get all url addresses of original and sub images
#rm -f elephant-ramhacks-$ADDRESS

# get into the directory to download images from urls
# -nc: no duplicated download if the images are already in directory
# -i: download iamges form file
#cd source; wget -nc -i src_list ; rm -f src_list ; cd ..
#cd targets; wget -nc -i tar_list ; rm -f tar_list ; cd ..

# main application to execute the image comparison
./flannMatcher
